Rental Application Designer README
This rental application is designed to provide a seamless experience for users looking to find and apply for rental properties. As a designer, my goal was to create an app that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provided all the necessary information to make informed rental decisions.

Design Considerations
Branding
The branding for this rental application was kept clean and modern, with a focus on using a simple color scheme and typography. The primary color is a deep blue, which conveys trust and stability, and is complemented by a lighter shade of blue and gray for secondary colors. The font choices were carefully selected to be legible and easy to read on a mobile screen.

Navigation
The navigation was designed to be intuitive and easy to use. The main navigation is located at the bottom of the screen, with five icons that represent the main sections of the app: Home, Search, Favorites, Applications, and Profile. The icons are accompanied by text labels to make it clear what each section is for.

Listings
The listings were designed to showcase high-quality photos of each property, with clear and concise descriptions of the key features and amenities. Each listing includes a prominent call-to-action button that allows users to easily apply for the property or schedule a viewing.

Applications
The application process was designed to be as streamlined as possible. Users can apply for a property directly from the app, and can track the progress of their application in real-time. The application form was designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and helpful tips.

Conclusion
Overall, this rental application was designed to provide a seamless experience for users looking to find and apply for rental properties. By focusing on clean and modern branding, intuitive navigation, and streamlined applications, we believe that this app will be a valuable tool for anyone looking to rent a property.
